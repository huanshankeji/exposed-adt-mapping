# Exposed GADT mapping

A library based on [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) [DSL](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL) providing mappings between data entities and tables with support for generic algebraic data types (nested classes, type parameters, and sealed classes)

This project is an attemp to provide an alternative to [Exposed DAO](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DAO) while supporting some more advanced functional programming features. Also see JetBrains/Exposed#24 for more details.
