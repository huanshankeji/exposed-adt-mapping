# Exposed GADT mapping

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.huanshankeji/exposed-adt-mapping)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.huanshankeji/exposed-adt-mapping)

A library based on [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) [DSL](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL) providing mappings between data entities and tables with support for GADT (generalized algebraic data type), aka features including nested properties of composite class types, type parameters, and sealed classes

This project is an attemp to provide an alternative to [Exposed DAO](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DAO) while supporting some more advanced functional programming features. Also see JetBrains/Exposed#24 for more details.
