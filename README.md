# Exposed ADT mapping

A library based on [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) [DSL](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL) providing mappings between data entities and tables with support for (generic) algebraic data types

This project is an attemp to provide an alternative to [Exposed DAO](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DAO) while supporting some more advanced functional programming features. Also see JetBrains/Exposed#24 for more details.
